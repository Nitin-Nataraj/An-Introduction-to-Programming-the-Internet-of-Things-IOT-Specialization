## Peer-graded Assignment: Module 1 Peer Review: Identify and Analyze a Device

**Q) Identify and analyze a device that is an IoT device now, but in the past was a non-IoT device. Describe and list the features of the device. Compare the functions of the device in the past to the functions of the device now.**

  Old Lighting Systems:
  They usually provide light of single wavelength, i.e, one colour.
  Manual Switching.

  Modern Lighting Systems:
  They can be modified to illuminate different colours based on an event or requirement.
  Automatic Switching.

**Q) Compare the functions of the device in the past to the functions of the device now.**

  Old Lighting Systems:
  These systems can not be switched on or off using an application over the internet.
  In order to power them, a switch needs to be pressed manually.
  May heat up when used for long periods of time.

  Modern Lighting Systems:
  Modern LED-based Lighting systems now have the ability to be remotely switched on and off via an application, network or a universal remote. 
  Automatic Switching based on real-time events.
  More efficient.
  
**Q) For your chosen IoT device, list any improvements or any diminishments if they exist, over the non-IOT device. Describe any limitations that are present in the new IoT version of the device.**

  Improvements:
  Increase in the average lifetime. 
  Time or event-based alteration options.
  Low power consumption.
  RGB customization.
  
  Diminishments:
  No security

  Limitations:
  Response time is slow in some cases.
  
**Q) Describe any privacy issues with the IoT device that never existed in the original version of the device. Compare the price of the original device to the price of the new IoT version of the device. When performing a price comparison, attempt to normalize for the changing value of currency over time by using an online inflation calculator.**

  Old Lighting Systems:
  No privacy issues of any kind.
  Physical presence and manual intervention required to switch on or off such systems. 
  Lighting System installation for an average household costs about $1400 and over $200 dollars a year for repairs and maintenance.
  
  Modern Lighting Systems:
  Most of these systems utilize third-party apps to provide the aforementioned IoT services.
  These third-party apps might collect usage patterns and in some cases even location and contacts.
  Data stored in their cloud servers, if relatively unsecured, are subjected to hacker attacks.
  Lighting System installation for an average household costs about $1800 and around $80 dollars a year for repairs and maintenance.
